All notable changes to this skill are documented here.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-05

### Changed
- **Auto-leveling** — system promotes itself from CAPTURE → ANALYZE → SUGGEST → AUTO-APPLY based on observation count and instinct confidence. No user action needed.
- **No background daemon** — analysis runs inline at session start. Removed start-observer.sh, observer-loop.sh, PID management.
- **Simplified directory** — `~/.claude/instincts/` replaces `~/.claude/mulahazah/` with flat structure
- **jq optional** — observe.sh works with pure bash fallback if jq isn't installed
- **Leaner installer** — no daemon files copied, no config.json, no analyze.sh. Just skill + hook + command.
- **Smaller package** — removed agents/ and config.json from published files

### Removed
- Background observer daemon (deferred to v2.2 as opt-in)
- `~/.claude/mulahazah/` directory structure (replaced by `~/.claude/instincts/`)
- `rules.md` (replaced by YAML instinct files with confidence scoring)
- `bin/analyze.sh` (analysis now inline via SKILL.md prompt)

---

## [2.0.1] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- SKILL.md rewritten to be honest — removed claims about features that didn't work (YAML instinct auto-loading, graduated confidence enforcement)
- Law 7 now uses `~/.claude/mulahazah/rules.md` — a markdown file Claude can actually read/write reliably
- Added `bin/analyze.sh` — the actual analysis pipeline that was missing (calls Haiku to extract rules from observations)
- Added `commands/continuous-improve.md` — the actual `/continuous-improve` command file
- Installer now copies analyze.sh, command file, and initializes rules.md
- observer-loop.sh rewritten to use analyze.sh instead of broken YAML instinct pipeline
- README rewritten to match what the tool actually does

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added

- PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks for session observation
- Background Haiku observer agent for pattern detection
- Project-scoped observation (per-project JSONL files)
- `/continuous-improve` command
- `hooks/observe.sh` — lightweight observation hook (<50ms)
- `agents/` — observer agent scripts
- `config.json` — observer configuration

### Changed
- Upgraded from 5-phase framework to 7-Law system
- The Loop: Research → Plan → Execute → Verify → Reflect → Learn → Iterate
